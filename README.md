# HLT
Hamiltonian Learning Tomography (HLT) Python implementation using Qiskit

- This package is an implementation of the HLT algorithm as described in
our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10418 (referred as main text in the code documentation).
This implementation can be used for any state given a quantum circuit in the Qiskit framework which produce the state.

- See `./docs/html/index.html` for a full documentation of this package.

- It also provides analysis tool for Pauli decomposition which allows easy analysis of the locality of the produced state.

- See main.py for some examples of how to use this package to do HLT.
